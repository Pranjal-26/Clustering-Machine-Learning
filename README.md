# Clustering-Machine-Learning
Clustering is a Machine Learning Unsupervised Learning technique that involves the grouping of given unlabeled data.

## k-Means Clustering -
K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.

## Hierarchical Clustering -
Agglomerative clustering.

## Density-based Clustering -
DBSCAN
Density-based Clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Density, in this context, is defined as the number of points within a specified radius.
